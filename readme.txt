
Hogwarts Legacy Post-Launch Study

1. Introduction
Avalanche Software's recent release of 'Hogwarts Legacy' has sparked immense interest among Harry Potter enthusiasts and video game fans. Being the first release under Warner Bros. ownership, there's a concerted effort to optimize player satisfaction and meet elevated expectations. To guide post-launch support and future releases, this project undertakes a comprehensive study evaluating player perceptions. Furthermore, a competitive industry analysis is conducted to identify popular genres, platforms, and key competitors.

2. Sentiment Analysis
We deployed an XGBoost model trained on a manually labeled dataset, achieving a commendable weighted F1-score of 0.7. The analysis of sentiment distribution over the past year on the subreddit (see Fig 2.1) revealed spikes in engagement during teaser and trailer releases, demonstrating effective marketing in generating hype. During the early access period, negative discussions saw fluctuations, potentially tied to technical issues and player experiences. The impact of the day-1 patch, released on February 10th, is scrutinized, given the observed patterns.

3. Topic Modeling
Utilizing Wordcloud, Network Analysis, and Non-negative Matrix Factorization, we uncovered underlying themes in discussions. Negative pre-launch discussions primarily focused on concerns about the day-one patch, character customization, premium early access pricing, and the game's immersive experience. Post-launch, discussions shifted to performance-related issues, confirming concerns about the effectiveness of the day-1 patch. Positive post-launch discussions indicated overall satisfaction, showcasing that the game exceeded players' expectations despite initial technical hiccups.

4. Industry Analysis
An industry analysis (see Fig 4.1) highlighted EA studios' dominance in the Sports market and identified Treyarch, Infinity Ward, and Sledgehammer Games as leaders in the Shooters market with the Call of Duty series. Opportunities for Avalanche include exploring the Sports genre through adapting Quidditch and leveraging Warner Bros.' Sci-fi IPs for a unique approach to the Shooter genre. Additionally, catering to the popular Playstation platform is recommended, ensuring compatibility with proprietary immersive technologies to enhance the gaming experience.

In conclusion, this comprehensive post-launch study provides valuable insights for Avalanche Software, not only addressing the performance of 'Hogwarts Legacy' but also offering strategic recommendations for future endeavors in the dynamic gaming industry.
