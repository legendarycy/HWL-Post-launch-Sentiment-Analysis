75,2/10/2023 19:46,i2g5zx5,"Nice.

Love the upper work on the upper  Corner of the Hogwarts Symbol side, though Raven Claw is strangely hard to see.

Like the set up around.  Hufflepuff is really nice.  Naturally it's colors are black and yellow, so it ties really well.

Feed back for your consideration.

Slytherin, as others have said  may look really nice with the snake being larger and kind of woven through the symbol with its coils.

Raven call as well may benefit from the spread wing Eagle being larger behind the symbol,  perhaps shifted slightly more upwards.

I think it is mainly just noticing the size in comparison to the more prominent Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, as though nicely understated, it makes them seem less I'm comparison 

Only other consideration I would but forth is the Hogwarts symbol on the other panel being a full multi color version instead of solid color.
Kind of a contrast tying the house crest back into the fact they are all a part of Hogwarts proper. 
Perhaps the winged boars around the symbol at the base underneath.",,2,comment,tps68g,3,2022,positive

109,2/10/2023 17:12,i9vgjez,"Honestly, this GIF does not excite and it does a ton to worry. I wasn‚Äôt worried at all before but now I am. The AI of enemies once more looks semi-dead, there is a bug with an enemy, and the robe animations have been downgraded. 
They have yet to publish a single promotional video without major bugs in it. The initial reveal had lighting and rendering issues, the gameplay trailer most egregiously showed a house with no walls behind a tree and had a couple other issues. 

No matter what, I can‚Äôt shake the discomfort with them choosing to zone in on this footage. I don‚Äôt buy the narrative that they are confident bugs will be fixed and that is why they are openly showing them. You don‚Äôt market a product with its issues glaringly plastered all over the marketing. Either they can not gather sufficient non-errant footage from what they have made, or they are preparing for a messy launch. Neither bodes well.",,9,comment,uwusmk,5,2022,negative

It helps make the world feel alive and lived in (its why I always look for eating/drinking animations, disable fast travel, laying in beds etc).

It's also why I'm most excited for Starfield. But really hope Hogwart Legacy has some of that stuff you can do or at the very least make it easily moddable for down the road.

I know there are a ton of like minded players out there, so give the people what they want!

(also sorry OP you're getting ripped to shreds by other redditors with the imagination of a rock when it comes to gaming. Roleplaying is definitely something that interests a lot of folks and it's the small things that can help immerse you into an open world game.

214,2/11/2023 8:27,j8chd1x,"I think they chose to create an expansive castle with multiple interesting ways of navigating it rather than ""here's the main staircase, now everything has to lead directly somewhere from here"". It would be limiting, creatively, I think. And when you look at the movie castle, I'm not even sure it makes sense. If one grand staircase can lead you everywhere, how would that look? Having a ""grand central station"" design is more logical from a ""visual fidelity"" standpoint, because ""this door taking you in that direction"" says little about what you have to navigate once you actually go through the door. Relying on a single staircase, divided into god knows how many floors and having classrooms etc built around and on said floors would essentially make Hogwarts more of a tower than a castle. The corridors would be supporting characters to the grand staircase's main character. I just don't think they could have made the castle look a way that hit nostalgically, was ""easy"" to navigate, and still felt magically complex and so incredibly beautiful and interesting inside all at the same time, if they had relied on a grand staircase based design.",,7,comment,110tcfb,2,2023,positive

246,2/11/2023 21:27,j2x7mkq,"I dont think it will be that bad, the game looks amazing however i do have some concerns about the PC specs and how the game is running.

The state of play video looks better (sharper, lighting is better and the particle effects are better) but the recent gaming showcases which were also recorded and uploaded in 4k just like the state of play looks like they ran at 30fps with some dips and the pop in for NPC's, lighting and texture buffering is very very noticeable. 

And the showcase was confirmed to be runnin on a PS5 Devkit which is more powerful than the base PS5

What scares me is the system requirements. 

It says we can get 60fps but only if we play at 1080p and then again only on low quality settings and then again its not native 1080p rather its only if it is upscaled at a performance setting.

The game graphically looked good but still has issues with lighting, pop in and reduced particle effects when comparing the state of play video and the new showcases.

I genuinely hope it is well optimised for PC, the specs may be good on there but what really matters is if the visual output of the game merits the requirements theyve set.

Hopefully we will see closer to release.

I do hope it runs and looks more like the state of play than it did in the recent showcases.",,1,comment,102tom9,5,2023,neutral

I recently went back to visit. 

I was shocked on how it was barely an inconvenience walking these stairs multiple times a day. I was out of breath walking up to the 4th floor once 20 years later. 

In short, you get used to it at that age. 

The students laughed that our school was like Hogwarts back then too. There were huge parts of the buildings that were considered ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù and not accessible to students. The school features multiple towers and a church and grounds with a park, running track, gardens, etc. 

At the 3rd year we had physical education (sports) and we noticed it was inside one of the buildings. To our shock there was an entire gymnasium on the 2nd floor no student knew was there. Pretty much like a room of requirement.

There definitely should've been a Malfoy-type rival that would bully you for having such unique thing as being sorted into a 5th year and also being escorted by a Professor and a Ministry Worker.

It doesn't need to be a Slytherin who does this. I'll be honest, it would be cool if there were a group of 4 students who would directly oppose you in school. Plus, I would've liked if there were NPC talks that talked about your achievments in negative way.

426,2/12/2023 16:07,j81223h,"I wouldn't go that far. It's pretty fun, but I dunno if I'd be engaged as much if it weren't a Harry Potter game. The gameplay loop feels rather ""generic Ubisoft game"" of going around the map and doing the same general things over and over again. The combat has some neat ideas, but is a bit too simplistic, accessing your various spells beyond whatever your first 4 are is kinda awkward, and the loose auto-target is rough with enemies having different colored shields that need different spells, especially when they are bunched together (pretty frustrating to repeatedly accidentally cast a yellow spell on the enemy next to the yellow shielded enemy, I'd have less complaints on that front if spells would automatically prioritize shielded enemies of the color you are casting).

  
It does really sell the world though which is it's main strength. Exploring the castle and the world around it is a lot of fun. So is all the obscure lore references and call backs(forwards?) to the books.
